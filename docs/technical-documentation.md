# Technical Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the technology stack chosen for the project, including the rationale behind each selection.

## Tech Stack

### Backend: Node.js & Express.js
- **Why Node.js?**
    - Asynchronous, event-driven architecture is well-suited for handling real-time features like chat and online status.
    - High performance with non-blocking I/O operations.
    - Large ecosystem with NPM packages to extend functionality.

- **Why Express.js?**
    - Lightweight and fast framework for building REST APIs.
    - Middleware support makes it easy to handle authentication, logging, and error handling.

### Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Why JavaScript?**
    - Universally supported in all browsers.
    - Enables dynamic content updates without requiring full-page reloads.

- **Why HTML & CSS?**
    - HTML structures the web pages.
    - CSS ensures a modern and responsive design.

### Database: MongoDB & Mongoose
- **Why MongoDB?**
    - NoSQL database that allows flexible schema design, useful for handling chat messages, user data, and real-time interactions.
    - Scales horizontally, making it a good choice for applications expecting a growing user base.

- **Why Mongoose?**
    - Provides a schema-based approach to managing data in MongoDB.
    - Helps with data validation and query building.

### WebSocket: Real-Time Chat & Online Status
- **Why WebSocket?**
    - Enables bidirectional, low-latency communication between the server and clients.
    - Reduces unnecessary HTTP requests, improving performance.

### Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Why JWT?**
    - Stateless authentication, meaning less server load compared to session-based authentication.
    - Secure, as tokens are signed and can be verified without storing them on the server.

### Admin Panel: React.js / Angular
- **Why React.js?**
    - Component-based architecture allows reusable UI components.
    - Efficient rendering using a virtual DOM.

- **Why Angular?**
    - Suitable for larger projects requiring structured development patterns.
    - Built-in support for handling forms, HTTP requests, and state management.
